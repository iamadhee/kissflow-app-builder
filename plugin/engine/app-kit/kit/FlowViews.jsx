/**
 * FlowTimeline · FlowBoard · Gate — the SDK-bound halves of Timeline and KanbanBoard.
 *
 * REDESIGNED 2026-08-13 from FlowViews.dc.html (Claude Design project "Mobile app style guide
 * sheet", 2b8a920b-a786-4430-bd63-b0bc0dbe6229) — its own framing: "The data-bound halves of the
 * timeline and the board. They take a flow id rather than rows, which means they own four states
 * the presentational versions never see — and those four states are the whole design problem."
 * The page names NO new tokens ("no new tokens — it is all composition"): every state reuses an
 * existing component (Skeleton, NoAccess, Callout, EmptyState); this file's whole job is the
 * ORDER those states are checked in, and what the write path may do to the interface while it
 * waits. See Gate below for the order, and FlowBoard for the write path.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE SEPARATE FILES from Feed.jsx and Board.jsx, rather than props on them: the
 * presentational versions take data and can be rendered in a catalog with fixtures; these fetch
 * and cannot. Folding a `flowId` prop into the presentational one would mean the catalog page
 * either calls the SDK or renders a permanently-loading component. So the split is
 *
 *     Feed.Timeline / Board.KanbanBoard      take data       — catalog-renderable
 *     FlowTimeline  / FlowBoard              take a flow id  — SDK-bound
 *
 * and the SDK-bound ones compose the presentational ones, never re-implementing their visuals.
 *
 * BOTH ARE FAITHFUL PORTS of legacy components that used the SDK and lost it in the first pass
 * of this rewrite — Timeline.jsx read a flow across Form/Process/Case, and KanbanBoard.jsx both
 * read a board AND called updateItem to move a card between columns. That write path is the one
 * piece of behaviour most at risk of being quietly dropped, so it is preserved here explicitly.

 * Gate — the shared four-state read every SDK-bound view in this file checks, IN THIS ORDER:
 *
 *   1. blocked   NoAccess, tone=neutral   — checked FIRST, before loading. [SOURCE] "A
 *                permission boundary is a fact about the viewer, rather than a wait — showing a
 *                skeleton first promises data that will never arrive."
 *   2. loading   GateSkeleton             — shaped like the row it stands in for, see above.
 *   3. error     a danger Callout with a mono `CODE · resource-id · elapsed-time` detail line and
 *                one Retry action, in an outline-in-currentColor button — Callout.jsx's own
 *                documented action-row convention (its file banner, "ACTIONS ARE NOT A PROP").
 *   4. empty     EmptyState, no tone, icon + title + helper copy.
 *   then Ready: render `children`, the real content.
 *
 * NEW export, per FlowViews.dc.html's own API table — this check used to live unexported and
 * private to this file. Pulling it out means any future data-bound view (ModelChart is this
 * file's own next candidate) reads the same four states in the same order, rather than
 * reimplementing the check with its own bugs.
 *
 * `empty` is `{ title, message, icon }`, not a bare string — EmptyState's own contract, and
 * FlowTimeline's and FlowBoard's copy genuinely differ, so Gate does not invent one default for
 * both callers. `resourceId` (the flow id) feeds the error line; the elapsed-time clock lives
 * here as a ref, reset whenever `state.loading` goes true, rather than in useFlow.js — Gate is
 * the only consumer of the hook that needs a duration, so timing it here leaves useFlow.js's
 * return shape untouched for its other callers (ModelChart, DataTable).

 * THE WRITE PATH. Moving a card calls `updateItem(id, { [groupField]: column })` and then

 * direction: `columns` is derived only from `state.rows` (below), and `state.rows` does not
 * change until `state.reload()`'s fetch resolves — so a card stays in its ORIGINAL column for the
 * whole time a move is in flight, and only actually moves once the write confirms. [SOURCE] "a
 * board that shows a move which then failed is worse than one that takes a moment." A failed move
 * surfaces as a danger Callout above the board; the card is simply still where it was.
 *
 * SAVING INDICATOR lives on the move control's own row, not on the KanbanBoard tile itself:
 * Board.jsx's card shape (`{id, title, note, owner, priority, progress, files, comments}`) has no
 * pending flag, and this file composes Board.jsx rather than reaching into its private BoardCard
 * — the same kind of gap Board.jsx's own banner names for drag-and-drop ("marked here so the gap
 * stays visible rather than looking like an oversight"). So a card mid-move fades its OWN label
 * in the control row to opacity-50 and shows "saving…" there, which is the one place this file
 * owns a per-item DOM node.
 *
 * Movement is a SELECT rather than drag-and-drop. The legacy board dragged; kit/ has no DnD and
 * adding one is a dependency decision nobody has made. A select is honest, keyboard-accessible,
 * and does the same thing.
